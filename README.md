## Session 1 ‚Äì Demo  
**Secure Storage Access Using ARM Template and RFC 1918 IP Strategy**

This hands-on demo walks participants through deploying a secure logging architecture using private networking and storage isolation.  
The deployment aligns with enterprise cloud security standards by enforcing private access via RFC 1918 ranges and private endpoints.

### üîß Lab Steps Overview

#### 1. Setup
- Prepare Visual Studio Code or Azure Cloud Shell  
- Ensure Azure CLI is installed and authenticated  
- Create a new resource group in the target region  

#### 2. Deploy Infrastructure
- Define an ARM template with a custom VNet and AppSubnet  
- Deploy an Azure Storage account with public access disabled  
- Provision a Private Endpoint for the storage account  
- Create and link a Private DNS Zone for internal name resolution  

#### 3. Test and Validate
- Confirm DNS resolution returns a private IP address  
- Attempt access from outside the network to ensure it fails  
- Deploy a Linux VM in the subnet and test access to the storage privately  
- Optionally, enforce internet isolation using NSG outbound rules  

### ‚úÖ Expected Outcome
- A secure VNet using `10.50.0.0/16` with subnetting  
- A storage account that‚Äôs only accessible over the private network  
- DNS correctly resolving via `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`  
- Full validation that no public access is allowed, and internal routing works
