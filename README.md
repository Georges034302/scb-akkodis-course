### üß™ Hands-On Lab: Secure Storage Access Using ARM Template and RFC 1918 IP Strategy

#### üè∑Ô∏è Lab Title
Deploy a Secure Logging Architecture with Private Endpoint and RFC 1918 IP Strategy Using ARM JSON

#### üéØ Lab Objective
Deploy a logging subnet and storage account using RFC 1918 IP address space, and integrate it with a Private Endpoint and Private DNS Zone to enforce internal-only access ‚Äî following best practice cloud security architecture.

#### ‚úÖ Lab Scenario
A centralized logging application resides within AppSubnet. This app must write logs to an Azure Storage account, which must not be accessible over the internet.

### üß™ Hands-On Lab: NSG Flow Visibility Lab ‚Äì Monitor and Block Intra-VNet Traffic

#### üè∑Ô∏è Lab Title
Simulate and monitor denied traffic within Azure Virtual Networks using Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Flow Logs
