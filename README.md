## Session 1 ‚Äì Demo  
**Secure Storage Access Using ARM Template and RFC 1918 IP Strategy**

This hands-on demo walks participants through deploying a secure logging architecture using private networking and storage isolation.  
The deployment aligns with enterprise cloud security standards by enforcing private access via RFC 1918 ranges and private endpoints.

### üîß Lab Steps Overview

| Setup Step | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | Create the Resource Group                        |
| 2          | Create the ARM Template                          |

| Deploy Step | Description                                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | Deploy the ARM Template                         |
| 2           | Create the Private Endpoint                     |
| 3           | Create and Link Private DNS Zone                |

| Test Step   | Description                                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | Verify DNS Resolution (from inside the VNet)    |
| 2           | Confirm Public Access Blocked                   |
| 3           | (Optional) Create a Test VM in the VNet         |
| 4           | (Optional) SSH into the Test VM                 |
| 5           | (Optional) Test DNS and Storage Access from VM  |
| 6           | (Optional) Test Internet Blocking via NSG       |

| Expected Outcome | Description                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1                | Storage account is only accessible privately                     |
| 2                | DNS resolves to private IP inside the VNet                       |
| 3                | Public access is blocked as expected                             |
| 4                | Private endpoint and DNS zone are validated                      |
| 5                | A secure VNet using `10.50.0.0/16` with subnetting               |
| 6                | A storage account that‚Äôs only accessible over the private network|
| 7                | DNS correctly resolving via `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`  |
| 8                | Full validation that no public access is allowed, and internal routing works
