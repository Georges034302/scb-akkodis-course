### üß™ Hands-On Lab: Secure Storage Access Using ARM Template and RFC 1918 IP Strategy

#### üè∑Ô∏è Lab Title
Deploy a Secure Logging Architecture with Private Endpoint and RFC 1918 IP Strategy Using ARM JSON

#### üéØ Lab Objective
Deploy a logging subnet and storage account using RFC 1918 IP address space, and integrate it with a Private Endpoint and Private DNS Zone to enforce internal-only access ‚Äî following best practice cloud security architecture.

#### ‚úÖ Lab Scenario
A centralized logging application resides within AppSubnet. This app must write logs to an Azure Storage account, which must not be accessible over the internet.

### üîß Lab Steps Overview

| Setup Step | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | Create the Resource Group                        |
| 2          | Create the ARM Template                          |

| Deploy Step | Description                                     |

| 1           | Deploy the ARM Template                         |
| 2           | Create the Private Endpoint                     |
| 3           | Create and Link Private DNS Zone                |

| Test Step   | Description                                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | Verify DNS Resolution (from inside the VNet)    |
| 2           | Confirm Public Access Blocked                   |
| 3           | (Optional) Create a Test VM in the VNet         |
| 4           | (Optional) SSH into the Test VM                 |
| 5           | (Optional) Test DNS and Storage Access from VM  |
| 6           | (Optional) Test Internet Blocking via NSG       |

| Expected Outcome | Description                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1                | Storage account is only accessible privately                     |

| 3                | Public access is blocked as expected                             |
| 4                | Private endpoint and DNS zone are validated                      |
| 5                | A secure VNet using `10.50.0.0/16` with subnetting               |
| 6                | A storage account that‚Äôs only accessible over the private network|
| 7                | DNS correctly resolving via `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`  |
| 8                | Full validation that no public access is allowed, and internal routing works

### üß™ Hands-On Lab: Sentinel Lab ‚Äì Key Vault Detection

#### üè∑Ô∏è Lab Title
Detect and Respond to Suspicious Access Patterns in Azure Key Vault Using Microsoft Sentinel

#### üéØ Lab Objective
Simulate and detect excessive secret access by a privileged identity, trigger a Microsoft Sentinel analytics rule, and automate the response using a Logic App to disable the account and notify the SOC team.

#### ‚úÖ Lab Scenario
A privileged user retrieves secrets from Azure Key Vault more frequently than expected, indicating possible insider threat or credential misuse.
